# C-To-Python-Transpiler

In this project, a valid C code is converted to a Python code(Not all codes are compatible, access the report to see the features supported).
I have used Haskell and Python for this project. Haskell is used for converting the C syntax to python syntax.
Python script is used to give indentation to the converted code by by haskell.

First run the project.hs file, which will convert the code to python syntax. Now run indentation.py on the output of project.hs file.
